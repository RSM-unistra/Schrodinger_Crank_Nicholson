# Crank-Nicholson Solver for the Schrödinger Equation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Crank-Nicholson method to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes with time.

## Features

- Implementation of the Crank-Nicholson method for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
- Support for various potential functions.
- Visualization of the wave function evolution.

## Getting Started
